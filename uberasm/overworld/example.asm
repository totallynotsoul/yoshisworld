; This is an example code file for UberASMTool.
; The code in this file does nothing.
; By default, it runs on the Yoshi's Island map, because of the entry "1 example.asm" in the "overworld" list (in the list.txt file).
; You can safely remove that entry. After you do that, you can also safely remove this file.
